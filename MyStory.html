      My Kesem Story!
    </div>
    <div class="dashed bg-skyblue">
      I joined the University of Miami’s Camp Kesem Chapter in my second semester of my  freshman year in college.  I had no idea what was in store for me! 

One wednesday evening my now Best friend Chelsey Guastucci told me she was on her way to a club meeting for an organization on campus and invited me to tag along.  As I accepted the offer, I assumed I would simply sit in the room with her and wait until the meeting was over but,  that was definitely not what happened. I walked into the room...sat down… and immediately felt extreme amounts of love and passion from the students in the organization. The members of Camp Kesem made me feel right at home! We sang a ton of camp songs and they even gave me a camp name that I now embrace and love dearly.   After all of the fun, we also got a chance to settle down and discuss why everyone was really there.  Singing songs and playing games brings a lot of joy into my life but this organization is more than that.  Camp Kesem is based around supporting children through tough times, specifically dealing with a parent who has cancer, and giving them the love and support they need.  Every person in that meeting has or has had their own experiences with or knew someone who had dealt with cancer.  This hits right at home for me because I have had members of my family suffer and unfortunately lose their battle with cancer.  Dealing with cancer is really hard and I know what it feels like to lose a loved one. That is why I joined Kesem.  I understand the feelings one might have when in this situation and I want to be that support system for the people who find themselves in this unfortunate situation.  After attending that meeting, I knew this was something I needed to take part in during my college experience and in my life as a whole. 
Since that meeting, my time in the organization has been incredible and surprisingly  always gets better and better! I attended more camp meetings, participated in fundraisers around campus and was also invited to be a counselor during their 2019 summer camp! I have had the opportunity to meet amazing counselors and campers and experience moments I will never forget and will always keep close to my heart.  The children and counselors in my pictures throughout this website are so special and I am honored to know them and be involved with such a life changing organization.   Camp Kesem has the power to create a strong and loving community for kids and families going through similar experiences. I kesem to be there for people who need a shoulder to lean on. I kesem to see children smile.  I kesem because everyone deserves to feel the magic kesem fosters.
